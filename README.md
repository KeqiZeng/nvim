# Kecht's personal Nvimconf

Tired to open many files when change my config, so written all config in init.lua

Run lspinstall.sh to install or update Language Server Protocol(require homebrew, npm, pip, and go). On MacOS, I use clangd for c and cpp, which is included in Xcode-CommandLine-Tools, so need to run `xcode-select --install` to install it manually.

Two dictionaries(one for English, another for Deutsch) include in `dict` to support words completion.
